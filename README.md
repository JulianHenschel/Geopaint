# geopaint.net

Our project is an interactive painting program. But instead of a piece of paper or a Photoshop document, our canvas is the whole world!

Well, in the form of a map. The user becomes the painter at large scale. Use your smartphone as a brush by going to the website and draw new lines in the map by going around. The application will periodically fetch your current location and connect the dots to line paintings, similar to the biggest drawing in the world.

The application being a website is a great advantage, it means that it is platform-independent. That way you can use geopaint.net with any device that supports geolocation via HTML5 or Gears. So you may as well run around with your laptop. 

We are using jQTouch and Google Maps API for the interface, jQuery and Ajax for refreshing the map and PHP and MySQL for the server stuff.

## Miscellaneous

[Lee Pei Zhi](http://twitter.com/peeezac), an exchange student from Singapore, approached us with her project »Sketchwalk«. Unfortunately we don't have the time to collaborate on this, but you can always check out her project and drop her a line.

Thanks to everyone who helped us out, especially all the [painters from around the world](http://geopaint.net/labs/marker/). Be sure to check out the aggregated map with all projects on one!
